Package: AnalyzAIRR
Title: R Package Developed to Analyze Bulk Ig/TR Repertoire Datasets
Version: 1.2.1
Description: A general data exploration to evaluate the homogeneity 
 within defined groups, identify outliers and filter them out. AnalyzAIRR also proposes
 a set of diversity measures and statistical metrics applicable at any level of granularity. Thus, single-sample repertoire explorations or in-depth cross-comparisons of AIRR datasets 
 can be conducted leading to ready-to-publish visualization graphics. 
 AnalyzAIRR is complemented with a guided workflow to help users in their analytical strategy, and a Shiny web application making it user-friendly for biologists with little or no background in bioinformatics.
