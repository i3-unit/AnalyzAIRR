\title{AnalyzAIRR - AIRR-compliant R package for the analysis of bulk Ig/TCR repertoire datasets}
\description{
AnalyzAIRR is a AIRR-compliant R package developed to analyze bulk Ig/TCR repertoire datasets.
}
\details{
AnalyzAIRR allows a general data exploration to evaluate the homogeneity 
within defined groups, identify outliers and filter them out. AnalyzAIRR also proposes
a set of diversity measures and statistical metrics applicable at any level of granularity. Thus, single-sample repertoire explorations or in-depth cross-comparisons of AIRR datasets 
can be conducted leading to ready-to-publish visualization graphics. 
AnalyzAIRR is complemented with a guided workflow to help users in their analytical strategy, and a Shiny web application making it user-friendly for biologists with little or no background in bioinformatics.
